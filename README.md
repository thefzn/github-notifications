# How to mount

Still unpacked so we have to activate developer mode on `chrome://extensions/`.

1. Clone `git clone https://github.com/thefzn/github-notifications.git&&cd github-notifications`
2. Install `npm i`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. On Chrome go to your Extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`
5. Press **Load Unpacked**
6. Load the `/dist` folder
7. Press the newly added extension icon, (you can pin it to the extention bar too)
8. Log into your Github Account, and that's it
